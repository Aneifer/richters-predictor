# Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage

Predict the level of damage to buildings caused by earthquakes.

Based on aspects of building location and construction, this project predicts the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.

# Demo

Deployed on Streamlit.

# Dataset

This project uses data provided by [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/). The data was collected through surveys by [Kathmandu Living Labs](https://kathmandulivinglabs.org/) and the Central Bureau of Statistics, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

# Methods

Our team of data scientists from [Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com/) in Berlin developed a model to predict the level of damage to the buildings. We used a variety of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. We also used a variety of feature engineering techniques, including one-hot encoding, target encoding, frequency encoding, and feature scaling.

# Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
